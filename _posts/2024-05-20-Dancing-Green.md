[Raidplan](https://raidplan.io/plan/pztjVHnzfhEkg6pH)


##Tank Busters
- Dual Tank Busters
- Tank Busters are eminity base (Target 1st and 2nd on eminity)
- They do Magical DMG 
- Throw 120s mit on cd
- Warrior for dmg can just normal mit it and use vengance for dmg(why?)
- Always have Tank Stance and shrink on cd.
- MT voke at the beginning so OT doesn't steal agro
- They have a bleed.

##First Mechanic

Boss is going to cast Flip to A-Side or Flip to B-Side this will resolve after the one side cleave happens.

- Preposition yourself so if you forget you are in your spot.
- Boss will show both sides in the first 2 cleaves.


<table>
<tr>
    <th>Flip to A-Side</th>
    <th>Flip to B-Side</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th><img src="\images\Dancinggreen\A-Side.png" alt="A Side Spreads"></th>
    <th><img src="\images\Dancinggreen\B-Side.png" alt="B Side"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Stack with your roles can be survived alone just light mit through it and don't panic</th>
    <th>Stack with your group and light mitt it</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th><img src="/images/Dancinggreen/Aside Resolve.gif"></th>
    <th><img src="/images/Dancinggreen/Bside Resolve.gif"></th>
</tr>
</table>

##One side cleave

Boss is going to point to one side and cleave it the number of times indicated on the castbar and then cleave the opposite side.
- It always target West or East
- It can be 2-3-4 cleaves.
- After the indicated cleaves always cleaves opposite side.
- After cleaves resolve it's going to do the intended side casted.
- If u get distracted u can react to the cleave when boss stops moving his arm.

<img src="/images/Dancinggreen/Cleaving Side.gif">


##Celebrate Good Times (Raidwide)
- Rep and raidwide mit.
- Get inside boss hitbox for heals and astro things. 

##Disco Infernal


Probs the most gimmcik mechanic of the raid and the hardest.
Is going to change some squares to red and others to gray avoid the red ones is going to swap each activation so the previous safe aren't safe and viceversa.

Check your debuffs (Support/DPS based) [Need confirmation]
- 21secs takes your spotlight first.
- 30secs take your spotlight last.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Pattern 1
        </th>
        <th>
        Pattern 2
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/DiscoInfernal First Pattern.png">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/DiscoInfernal Second Pattern.png">
        </th>
    </tr>
</table>

### How to resolve this?
Remember you have Group 1 asignated WEST and Group 2 EAST
<ul>
  <li>Melees
    <ul>
      <li>If you short look at the first closest safe spotlight</li>
      <li>If you long check at the first closest unsafe spotlight.</li>
      <li>You can also just back think this if the first safe is south  then the safe spot is on east for long.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ranged</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The first far unsafespot is your safe spot.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

Now that u know your safe spot boss is going to do an In and Out mechanic. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Inside Out
        </th>
        <th>
        Outside In
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/InsideOut.gif">
        </th>
        <th>
        Gif Here
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Boss is going to hit inside and then outside.
        </th>
        <th>
        Boss is going to do a Donut and then the inside of the donut.
        </th>
</table>

## Another Raidwide and Tankbuster
No need to explain more

##Arcady Night Fever and Let's Dance

This mechanic is divided in 2 parts, first part is a dodge cleave that inflicts a debuff, and the other one is a dodge based one. Let's start with the first part.

### Arcady Night Fever
___

Boss is going to do IN>OUT>IN>OUT attacks. <br> 
While hitting Supporters and 1 DPS with cleaves. When you get hit by a cleave you move North/South whatever is closest. (Move fast cause it cleaves again your spot) 

<table>
<th>
<img src="/images/Dancinggreen/Arcady Night Fever.png">
</th>
<th>
<img src="/images/Dancinggreen/ArcadyNightFever.gif">
</th>
</table>

### Let's Dance
___

After Arcady Night Fever is over everyone will have a debuff. There is 2 ways of resolve this.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Standard PF
        </th>
        <th>
        North cleanse.
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/LetsDance.png">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/LetsDanceXenos.gif">
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Line up in a North to South conga shortest to longest debuff<br>
        5-10-15-20 order of conga.
        </th>
        <th>
        Everyone stacks south and the people who gotta cleanse go north.
        </th>
</table>


After selecting your strat and position yourself for the strat, in the background there is going to be frogs line up pointing to one direction (This one is always east or west)
<img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FrogDancing.png">

They are pointing at the side they are going to cleave so don't be there.


After everyone resolves this mechanic if u did your cleanse right and you didn't get hit by a cleave you are going to get a message in screen saying Perfect Groove

<img src="/images/Dancinggreen/PerfectGroove.gif">

This will give u a Damage Increase and if everyone got it you get an full LB Bar.

## Ride the Waves

Is going to make some easy to dodge exas, Main Tank should position the boss between both savespots so all melees can have uptime and is going to do an stack or spread depending on cast.

Group 1 West | Group 2 East 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Quarter Beat
        </th>
        <th>
            Eight Beat
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/Ride the Wave Spread.png">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/EigthBeat.png">
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Spread are big becareful not to clip the other melee and you will be fine
        </th>
        <th>
        When moving away just do normal spread
        <br>RDM just hold your mele combo a bit or do it early dw.
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/QuarterSpread.gif">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/Waves Octo.gif">
        </th>
    </tr>
</table>

After this mechanic resolves another Inside Out/Outside in. Into a Tank Buster. Resolve as normal.

## Frogtourage 1

Frogs are going to spawn and make everything unsafe except 4 Squares in N/S or W/E. Focus on one spot

- Group 1 N/W
- Group 2 S/E

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Quarter Beat
        </th>
        <th>
            Eight Beat
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FrogTourage Quad.png">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FrogTourage Octo.png">
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Just standard stacks melees can weave and go to their spots fine.
        </th>
        <th>
        The same as stacks you can weave out.
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Placeholder
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FrogSpread.gif">
        </th>
</table>

## Disco Infernal 2

Everyone gets a debuff 1 Role gets Shorter the other one gets long timer.

Long timer bait frog cleaves outside the lights, Short Timer takes the spotlight and then viceversa, pretty straightforward

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
           Disco Infernal Cardinals 
        </th>
        <th>
           Disco Infernal Intercardinal 
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/InfernalCardinalSafe.png">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/InfernalCardinalIntercardinal.png">
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        You can sprint and get to the spotlight if in max melee range.<br>
        (If one guy is dead and you are in static you can inv in the middle and it will make everything safe or if dps dies)
        </th>
        <th>
        The same as cardinals. even more comfy.
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/CardinalSafeInfernal.gif">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/InterCardinalSafe.gif">
        </th>
</table>

## Another Arcady Night Fever without Debuffs

Just do the same spots as the previous one.

## Let's Dance 2

Same as the first one but now can cleave North and South. Putting it here and showing video example to help.

You can look ahead to preplant before it cleaves north if it's only doing west or east and viceversa but you can calm and dodge normally.

## Frogtourage 2

<table>
<th>
 <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FrogTourage2.png"> 
</th>
<th>
 <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FrogTourage2.gif">
</th>
</table>

2 Frogs are going to spawn and cleave one side,best way to resolve is look at one frog safe side and check the other if the other frog is cleaving the safe spot is besides the cleaving one.

After this boss is also going to make a cleave on 1 side.


## Frogs?

Like Frogtourage 1 some frogs are going to make the floor unsafe. It can be middle safe or sides safe.

Supporters take the first Bait, DPS Second one.


<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
          Sides Safe
        </th>
        <th>
          Midle Safe
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/SideSafe.png">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/MiddleSafe.png">
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        You can sprint and get to the safe spot if in max melee range.<br>
        If one guy is dead tanks can inv to avoid wipe 
        </th>
        <th>
        Same as Sides but easy uptime. Just be Max melee range
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/Frog Side Safe.gif">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FrogMiddle.gif">
        </th>
</table>


## Frog?

Same as Frougtourage 2 but cleaving West-East

<table>
<th>
 <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/Frog3.png"> 
</th>
<th>
 <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/Frog3.gif">
</th>
</table>


## Funky Floor 2

As the first one is going to make some times safe and the other unsafe. With an In/Out Mechanic.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
          Sides Safe
        </th>
        <th>
          Midle Safe
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FunkyFloor 2 Stack.png">
        </th>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FunkyFLoorSpread.png">
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Just use eyes
        </th>
        <th>
        Just Use Eyes.
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <img src="/images/Dancinggreen/FunkyFloor2 Stack.gif">
        </th>
        <th>

</table>
